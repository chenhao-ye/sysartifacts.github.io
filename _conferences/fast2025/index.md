title: Artifact Evaluation
order: 0
---

A scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself, possibly including software, hardware, evaluation data, documentation, survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, and benchmarks. In some cases, the quality of these artifacts is as important as the document itself. FAST '25 will continue the artifact evaluation process established in FAST '24 for all accepted papers.

Questions about the process can be directed to [fast25aec@usenix.org](mailto:fast25aec@usenix.org?subject=Question%20about%20FAST%20'25%20Artifact%20Evaluation%20Submission%20Process).
